**User can buy Tokens from a website using MetaMask account Ethers.**

  --> Run "cd client" and "npm run start".
  --> Choose "Ropsten Test Network" 
  
**How it works?** 
1)  First, whitelist your account for KYC before making any Transaction:
  --> Copy MetaMask account address and paste it in "Add Address to Whitelist" blank field.
2) Afterwards, you have 2 choices to buy Tokens:
  --> Either, click on "Buy Token" button to buy only 1 CAPPU token
  --> Or, directly pay to given address "Send Ether to this Address" on website using MetaMask account to buy more than 1 CAPPU tokens.
  
**NOTE**
